imperative computer programming languages  originally developed in the mid 1950s  which greatly influenced many other languages and was the standard method for algorithm description used by the ACM in textbooks and academic sources for more than thirty years  There were three major specifications  Algol is substantially different from Algol and was not well received  so that in general  Algol  means Algol and dialects thereof  Fragments of ALGOL like syntax are sometimes still used as pseudocode  AWK is a programming language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool  It is a standard feature of most Unix like operating systems  The AWK language is a data driven scripting language consisting of a set of actions to be taken against streams of textual data – either run directly on files or used as part of a pipeline – for purposes of extracting or transforming text  such as producing formatted reports  The language extensively uses the string datatype  associative arrays  that is  arrays indexed by key strings   and regular expressions  While AWK has a limited intended application domain and was especially designed to support one liner programs  the language is Turing complete  and even the early Bell Labs users of AWK often wrote well st APL  named after the book A Programming Language  is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E  Iverson  Its central datatype is the multidimensional array  It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators  leading to very concise code  It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling  spreadsheets  functional programming  and computer math packages  It has also inspired several other

of Cambridge in  Originally intended for writing compilers for other languages  BCPL is no longer in common use  However  its influence is still felt because a stripped down and syntactically changed version of BCPL  called B  was the language on which the C programming language was based  This led many C programmers to give BCPL the humorous backronym Before C Programming Language  Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in by Urban Müller  and notable for its extreme minimalism  The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer  While it is fully Turing complete  it is not intended for practical use  but to challenge and amuse programmers  The language s name is a reference to the slang term brainfuck  which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one s understanding  B is a programming language developed at Bell Labs circa  It is the work of Ken Thompson with Dennis Ritchie  B was derived from BCPL  and its name may be a contraction of BCPL  Thompson s coworker Dennis Ritchie speculated that the name might be based on Bon  an earlier  but unrelated  programming language that Thompson designed for use
